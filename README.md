Phantom.js + node.js + client side js = American Apparel slideshow. Makes for great dynamic background imagery (fullscreen it in firefox, then alt-tab away)

##Requirements##

- coffee
- phantom.js
- node.js + jsdom
- lighttpd (or some other http server)

##Usage##

Run `./run` if you have lighttpd in your path.
If not, `coffee node.coffee` and run `index.html` from your http server of choice and hit up http://localhost:3000. Oh, and fullscreen that sucker.
